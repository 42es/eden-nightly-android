```xml
<emulator name="EDEN-NIGHTLY">
		<!-- Nintendo Switch emulator Eden Nightly build -->
		<rule type="androidpackage">			
			<entry>dev.eden.eden_emulator.nightly/org.yuzu.yuzu_emu.activities.EmulationActivity</entry>
		</rule>
	</emulator>
```
- Save the changes.
- Then in your `es_systems.xml` file search for `Eden (Standalone)`.
- Make a new line below the string you just searched and paste:
```xml
<command label="Eden (Standalone-Nightly)">%EMULATOR_EDEN-NIGHTLY% %ACTION%=android.nfc.action.TECH_DISCOVERED %DATA%=%ROMPROVIDER%</command>
